The goal: symbolic regression. This is just a repository to hold the code I am working on.

# How to compile

You require `cmake` to be installed.

1. Compile the 'library':
    - `./compile.sh lib`
2. Compile the command line interface:
    - `./compile.sh cli`
3. Compile the viewer
    - Open up the .pro file in QtCreator
